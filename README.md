# Orbit-Simulator
 Simple orbit simulators written in python, for my 2nd year programming project. The 2D version makes use of pygame and the 3D version makes use of ursina.

Installation:
1) Clone this repo
2) Install pygame with "pip install pygame"
3) Install ursina with "pip install ursina"
4) Run 3d_orbits.py for the 3d simulator, or 2d_orbits.py for the 2d simulator
